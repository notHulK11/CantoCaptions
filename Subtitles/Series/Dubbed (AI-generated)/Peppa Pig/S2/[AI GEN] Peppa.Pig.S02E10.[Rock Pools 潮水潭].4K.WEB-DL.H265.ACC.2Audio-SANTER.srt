1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,520
我叫做Peppa
而佢就係我細佬George，佢就係豬太太

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,620
佢係豬先生，哈哈…
我係Peppa，潮水潭

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,000
Peppa同George
跟住豬爺爺同豬媽媽去海邊玩

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,640
Peppa同George好鍾意海邊

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,940
阿，啲沙去咗邊啊？

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,320
呢個沙灘係冇沙㗎，Peppa

7
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,650
冇沙？

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,580
但係我哋想喺度堆沙成堡喎

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,540
Peppa同
George好鍾意堆沙成堡

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,860
你乖喇，George，唔好喊啦

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,880
喺呢個石灘上面仲有好多
刺激嘅嘢可以做㗎

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,060
例如係咩？

13
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,900
當啲海水退咗之後
喺石與石之間就會留低啲小水潭㗎喇

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,320
佢哋叫做潮水潭

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,780
而喺每一個由海水造成嘅潮水潭入面
都有啲好特別嘅嘢

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,600
我見到有啲嘢閃閃下

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,140
係個硬幣啊

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,720
呢個硬幣可能係海盜嘅寶藏

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,220
不如將我哋揾到嘅嘢收集埋一齊吖

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,700
好啊，將揾到嘅嘢放係
Ge orge個寫筒

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,900
唔知呢個潮水潭有咩驚喜等緊我哋呢？

22
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,120
呢個潮水潭入面都冇特別嘅嘢嘎？

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,580
每個潮水潭總有啲嘢嘅Peppa
細心啲睇下

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,120
嘩，真係有啲嘢喎

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,260
係啊，又隻

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,900
哎吔，~~~隻蟹鉗住豬爺爺隻手指啊

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,270
哦

28
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,940
蟹先生，你真係白豔啊

29
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:11,320
嘿…睇下George
原來蟹先生係打橫行嘎

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,520
George，扮蟹噉樣行？

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Pepper都想做隻蟹喎

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,320
我哋係白豔嘅蟹

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,220
鉗…鉗

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
救命啊

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,140
呢度有兩隻好白豔嘅蟹要嚟鉗我啊

36
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,560
我哋係好白豔嘅蟹

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,040
鉗

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,400
鉗

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,290
鉗

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,520
走啊

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,900
走啊

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,440
你兩隻白豔嘅蟹，返去你哋嘅潮水潭仔度

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,590
係喎

44
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,240
我哋係睇下其他嘅潮水潭喇

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,740
你見到啲咩啊？

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,340
一個貝殼

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,080
聽唔聽到海浪聲啊？

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,560
真係咩意思啊？

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,480
如果你放個貝殼喺隻耳仔度
你可以聽到海浪聲嘅

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,540
我聽到海浪聲啊

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,690
海浪

52
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,630
George
你可唔可以執個貝殼返嚟啊？

53
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,490
貝殼

54
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:21,970
呢個唔係貝殼啊

55
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,730
Pepper講得冇錯

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,050
呢個唔係貝殼

57
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,770
George揾到一嚿…

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,070
化石啊

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,490
咩係化石啊？

60
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,110
化石喺一啲好耐…以前動物嘅骸骨

61
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,230
嚟到恐龍時代嗰陣咁耐

62
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,730
恐龍

63
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,270
潮水潭真係好好玩啊

64
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,210
係啊

65
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,610
我哋就好好玩

66
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,310
但係對於呢條魚仔就唔係喇

67
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,320
魚仔？

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,250
喺邊啊？

69
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,510
條魚仔真係可憐啊

70
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,670
佢被混喺呢一度

71
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,010
條魚仔話…

72
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,050
佢好想而家返返去大海度喎

73
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,990
或者你可以用
George嘅水桶嚟救返佢喎

74
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,220
係喎

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,490
Pepper用水桶將條魚仔救起

76
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,445
Pepper用水桶將條魚仔救起

77
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,870
魚太太，你唔使擔心

78
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,990
你好快會同啲朋友一齊

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,700
魚太太，你唔使擔心

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,210
魚太太，拜拜

81
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,940
拜拜

82
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,390
我鍾意潮水潭

83
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,810
Pepper Pig

84
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,570
熊貓姐哥吐了

85
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,950
值得見噏…
