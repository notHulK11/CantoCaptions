1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,400
我叫做Peppa
而佢就係我細佬George，佢就係豬太太

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
佢係豬先生，我係Peppa

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,000
George嘅氣球今日Peppa、
George同豬爺爺豬媽媽一齊出去玩

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,920
係雪糕啊

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,360
呢架係兔小姐嘅雪糕車

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,800
咪如停低食杯雪糕啊
好提議啊，我認為我哋應該要食啊

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,580
你哋好啊

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,740
你好啊，兔小姐，四杯雪糕啊，唔該

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,780
即刻就嚟，請問要咩味啊？

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,620
我要士多啤梨味啊，唔該

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,480
我要朱古力味啊，唔該

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
我要香蕉味啊，唔該

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,140
恐龍

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,860
我唔認為會有恐龍味嘅雪糕啊

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,100
我諗George係
想要一個恐龍氣球啊

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,900
你真係唔想食雪糕咩
係咪啊，Ge orge？

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,950
唔想

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,240
恐龍

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,000
個恐龍氣球幾錢呀？

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,350
十磅啊

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,180
要十磅呀？

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,700
物超所值㗎

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,400
畀你㗎，George

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,040
你要捉實啊，唔好放手啊

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,960
George，放開咗個氣球喎

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,680
或者都係等我嚟拎呢一個
好貴嘅恐龍氣球返去

27
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,760
我哋都返屋企先喇

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,900
George好鍾意佢個恐龍氣球啊

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Pepper同George已經
返到豬爺爺同豬媽媽屋企喇

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,760
今次要捉實喇
George，唔好放手啊

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,030
點解啊？

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,940
George，世界上係有兩種氣球㗎

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,760
會上升嘅氣球同會下降嘅氣球

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,880
呢個係會上升嘅氣球

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,740
如果你放手㗎，話，佢就會一直上升…

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,760
升到上月球㗎喇

37
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,130
月球？

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,640
爺爺

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
捉到喇

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,420
喺個氣球飛咗去之前
我諗我哋都係返入屋好啲啦

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,180
呢個氣球喺度應該會安全㗎喇

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,060
你好啊，Polly

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,300
George有個新氣球啊

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,010
氣球

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,760
唔好整爆佢啊，Polly

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,340
George好鍾意呢個氣球㗎

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
George又再次放開咗佢個氣球喇

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,920
唔使擔心㗎，George
佢唔會飛走㗎，因為屋頂會擋住佢

49
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,500
噢

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
佢穿過咗道門喇

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,860
佢飛咗上樓上啊

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
唔使擔心㗎

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,460
各樓上面只有一個出口
就係屋頂上面嗰隻窗喇

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,460
而嗰個窗不嬲都係關埋嘅

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,740
噢，敗喇

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,540
屋頂上面嘅窗打開咗啊

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,120
爺爺，捉住佢啊

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,740
捉唔到啊，Peppa

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,800
佢飛咗上天空喇

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,820
George，呢個氣球而家飛緊上月球

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,500
你永遠都見佢唔到喇

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,680
朱先生，你接Peppa同
Ge orge返屋企啊

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,760
你好啊，你哋玩得開唔開心啊？

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,840
今日我哋買咗個恐龍氣球
畀Ge orge啊

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,800
但係George放開咗佢
佢而家飛緊上月球喇

66
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,740
我哋一定有辦法可以拎返佢㗎

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
氣球

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,660
睇下，Polly飛緊去個氣球度啊

69
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,900
Polly上會拯救個氣球啊

70
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,120
去啦，Polly，去啦

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Polly拯救咗
George個氣球啊

72
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,500
好嘢

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,240
邊個係聰明嘅Polly啊？

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,120
邊個係聰明嘅Polly啊？

75
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,410
George
唔好再放開你個氣球啦，知唔？

76
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:30,890
有辦法可以將條繩綁喺
George隻手度

77
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,530
真係個好主意啊

78
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,890
George中意佢個恐龍氣球

79
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,710
佢個人都中意
George嘅恐龍氣球啊

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,750
快啊

81
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,630
拍個Pic

82
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,270
拍個Pic

83
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,450
拍個Pic
