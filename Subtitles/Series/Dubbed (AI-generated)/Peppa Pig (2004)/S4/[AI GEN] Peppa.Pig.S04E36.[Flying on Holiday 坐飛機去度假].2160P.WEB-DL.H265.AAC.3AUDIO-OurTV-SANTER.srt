悲恨假期Pepper同George
要去度假，佢哋而家執緊行李啊

你好啊， Pepper
不如一齊玩啦

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,540
我今日唔可以陪你玩喇，因為我要去度假

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,360
噢，要去邊度假？

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,400
我唔知道啊，係假日去嘅某個地方掛

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,200
聽落好似唔錯噉喎

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,980
噢，爺爺同埋媽媽，你哋點解會嚟㗎？

21
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,640
我哋係為咗金魚Goldie嚟㗎

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,140
你哋度假嗰陣，我哋會照顧佢

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
佢就係Goldie喇

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,940
你唔好為得佢太飽啊，媽媽

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,200

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880

佢屋企人去機場㗎

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
請問有冇行李？

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,360
有啊，只不過…我…我怕佢可能會超重

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,640
唔使擔心，放上嚟先喇

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,460

請你哋過去嗰邊排隊啦

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,360

佢屋企人一齊去度假㗎

因為我哋而家喺雲上面
架飛機飛得越嚟越高喇
