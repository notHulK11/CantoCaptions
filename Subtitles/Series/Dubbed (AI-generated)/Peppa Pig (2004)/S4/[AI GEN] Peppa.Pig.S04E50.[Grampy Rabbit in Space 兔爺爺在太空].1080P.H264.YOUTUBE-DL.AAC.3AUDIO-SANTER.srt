1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,380
我叫做Peppa
而佢就係我細佬George，佢就係豬太太

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,820
佢係豬先生，我係Peppa
兔爺爺漫遊太空，Peppa同盟友喺暢遊班

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,680
小朋友，今日有一位特別嘉賓嚟咗喎
兔爺爺今日佢會同我哋咁多位

4
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,980
介紹太空火燈

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,630
火箭？

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
George好鍾意太空火箭㗎

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,820
各位，你哋好啊

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
兔爺爺講嘢好大聲啊

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,480
睇下我攞住啲咩啊？

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,630
石頭

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,720
冇錯，不過唔係普通嘅石頭
係我喺月球發現到嘅石頭嚟㗎

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,980
我爸爸買嘅石頭每包有五塊㗎

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,140
好犀利喎，Freddy

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,560
你唔使去月球都可以得到佢哋㗎
你要既係月球岩石就要去啦

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,240
兔爺爺，你係點樣去到月球㗎？

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,100
我係坐火箭去囖

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,920
佢好細步喎

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,080
呢步只係冇盈利㗎咋

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,840
我坐去月球嘅火箭係好大㗎

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,260
你哋應該知道點樣由一數到五個，可？

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,390
知

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,360
一、二、三、四、五

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,940
非常好啊

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,060
但當你準備升空嘅時候
我哋就要都數喇

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,540
五、四、三、二、一

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,100
然後你哋就要大聲喊發射

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,160
你哋記住要盡可能大聲喊出嚟

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,150
發射

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,840
我聽得唔係好清楚喎

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,940
發射

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,280
我就喺嗰度

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,120
喺火箭人面飛越太空

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,980
然後我就喺嗰陣登陸月球

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,300
月球上面真係好靚㗎

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,260
簡直就難以形容㗎

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,460
唔差喎

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,720
你哋知唔知喺月球上面
係可以跳得好高㗎

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
幾高呀？

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,580
差唔多一間屋咁高㗎

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,260
喺月球點解可以跳得咁高？

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,500
噉應該係因為月球引力較細

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,880
冇錯喇，就係噉喇
小朋友，你好聰明㗎

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,620
Edmond，係好聰明㗎

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,700
喺月球度我真係有啲孤獨㗎

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,820
淨係得月亮同埋星星

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,360
只不過最令人興奮嘅就係…

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,300
噉最令人興奮嘅即係乜嘢啊，兔爺爺？

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
聽唔到你講嘢啊

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,220
佢做咩突然唔講嘢𠸏？

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,420
閉喇，兔爺爺佢失咗聲喇

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,160
我打電話畀鍾雄醫生先喇

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,460
我係鍾雄醫生啊，有咩事啊？

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,100
你好啊，鍾雄醫生

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,720
兔爺爺突然失咗聲啊

55
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,680
噉就真係唔係幾好喎

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,700
梗係，佢同緊班小朋友講緊
啲關於太空火箭嘅嘢啊

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
原來係噉，我即刻過嚟揾你哋喇

58
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,440
你幾好嘛，兔爺爺

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,720
聽講你突然失咗聲喎

60
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,180
試下啊，噉啊

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
原來係噉
睇嚟你真係失聲失得好嚴重喎

62
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,520
我諗你應該係頭先咬得太多喇

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,040
試下食啲藥，睇下會唔會有幫助喇

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,310
抹大口喇

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,660
再試下？

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,950
噉啊

67
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
再抹大啲？

68
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,580
好好多喇
雖然未冇乎正常，但差唔多喇

69
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,320
係喇，頭先講到邊話？

70
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,400
你頭先應該係講到最令人興奮嘅部分喇

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,280
冇錯啊，最令人興奮嘅
就係我寫咗首歌啊

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,580
想唔想聽吓？

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
唔使啦，多謝

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,960
想啊，唱喇，好…

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,960
