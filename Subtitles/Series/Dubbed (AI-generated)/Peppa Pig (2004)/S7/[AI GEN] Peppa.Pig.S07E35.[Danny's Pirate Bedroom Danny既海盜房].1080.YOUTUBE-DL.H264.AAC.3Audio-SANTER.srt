1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,250
Pepper而佢呢係我
嘅細佬George

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,970
呢個係我…嘅Daddy

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,210
粉紅豬一家餐

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,570
Danny嘅海盜房

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,870
Pepper今日會去
Danny屋企度玩

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,500
你好

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,430
Danny你好啊

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,270
Pepper啱喇，你可以嚟幫我哋吖

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,670
我哋咁啱幫Danny
改裝緊佢間睡房啊

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,410
聽落好有意思噉喎
Pepper我啱啲嚟接你喇

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,810
Daddy拜拜喇

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,090
我唔明啊，乜嘢係睡房改裝啊？

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,150
好似有啲電視節目噉
我哋會將呢間房變到完全唔一樣

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,070
我好快就會有一間海盜

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,550
噉我哋今日會將成間睡房重新游一次遊

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,210
我哋會喺牆度畫出大海嘅感覺

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,390
而天花板會有星星嘅裝飾

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,230
噉我瞓覺嗰陣就好似喺海盜航行緊噉啊

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,710
係啊，係海啊

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,070
我仲記得航海嘅日子

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,070
喺星空下航行

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,890
我開住隻船仔，想去邊度就可以去邊度

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,450
仲可以去尋找海怪𠻹

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,550
嗰啲日子都過咗去啦

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,690
而家我返到嚟屋企，我就…
我就唔會再出海航行㗎喇

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,020
舊船長？

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,110
掛住大海？

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,810
好啦，我哋而家就開始郁手改裝睡房

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,810
用牀單蓋住傢具先

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,670
噉啲油漆就唔會滴落啲傢具度喇

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,250
為咗唔想啲油漆整污糟件衫
我哋仲要着工作服𠻹

32
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,850
呢罐深藍色嘅油係用嚟劃個天嘅

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,330
劃出嚟嘅會係夜晚嘅天空

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,650
舊太太用緊一個有碌油天花板

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,930
佢有好長…嘅手柄

36
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,610
我哋幫手得唔得啊？

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,910
梗係可以啦

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,890
畀油嫂你哋啊，噉一齊油蹦牆喇

39
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,270
哈哈…哈我而家畫喇

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,850
畫啲大農先

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,870
就好似真正嘅河一樣

42
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,750
噉等我嚟畫啲雨雲呢

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,710
我哋可唔可以用星星裝飾天花板？

44
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,390
丹尼梗係可以啦

45
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,740
噢

46
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,070
咩個天花唔

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,820
到啊

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,140
我哋嚟幫你哋喇

49
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,120
twinkle， tw inkle

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
bit of star

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,160
How nicely
those stars are

52
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,400
滾得…握住我

53
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,060
個天佈滿星星啊

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,940
熄咗盞燈嚟睇，效果仲靚𠻹啊

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,380
呢啲星星閃閃發光㗎

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
丹尼間睡房改裝好啦

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,000
呢間睡房同電視節目嗰啲
改裝房一樣咁靚啊

58
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:05,740
電視節目裏面，房嘅主人最初會合埋眼
睇到之後話實在係太驚

59
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:06,491
喜喇

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,520
但係，你都已經全部見到晒喇喎

61
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,060
我可以扮到自己未睇過㗎

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,780
丹尼呢個主意唔錯喎

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,340
係喎

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,200
為咗令效果好啲
而家你就企喺房門外面喇

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,920
請你合埋睇眼啦

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,600
等我哋生出到門先啦

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,200
丹尼，你準備好未啊？

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,740
得喇

69
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,960
我準備好喇

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
唔可睇大睇眼住啊

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,470
知道喇

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
好啦

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,280
可以入嚟喇

74
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,720
唔可以睇住㗎

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,760
而家你可以睇大睇眼睇喇

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,380
真係完全冇諗過會咁靚㗎

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,700
好啦

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,060
兩位小朋友，有邊個準備好養飯出海啊？

79
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,780
我

80
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,730
我

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,820
噉我哋就一齊上船喇

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,820
丹尼船長，我哋要駛去邊度啊？

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,160
我哋就一齊去揾海怪喇

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,240
你話去揾海怪呀？

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,400
對我嚟講，噉就好似係一場大冒險

86
