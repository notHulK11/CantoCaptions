00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,400
我叫做Peppa
而佢就係我細佬George，佢就係豬太太

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,980
佢係豬先生，我係Peppa

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,780
澳洲來陸
Peppa到咗澳洲去探袋鼠

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,060
我哋喺咪應該嚟之前通知佢哋先呢？

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,060
袋鼠先生你好啊

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,300
豬先生？

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,400
冇諗過你會嚟喎
你話如果我哋嚟澳洲，可以嚟揾你吖嘛

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,020
係啊…梗係可以

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,220
Kylie，你睇下邊個嚟咗？

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,180
Peppa你好啊

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,480
Kylie你好啊

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,300
George你好啊

13
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,100
仲記唔記得我細佬Joey啊？

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,310
Hello

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,420
阿姨

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,520
我哋要去野餐啊，不如一齊吖

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,920
好啊，一齊去啊

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,980
袋鼠家有一架私人飛機

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,960
你哋竟然有一架飛機

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,800
係啊，我哋要坐呢架飛機去野餐嗰度

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,300
大家都上嚟喇

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,540
你哋坐好未啊？

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,370
好啊

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,060
噉我哋就出發喇

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,660
我哋而家要去邊度野餐啊？

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,620
會去內陸一個好特別嘅地方

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,040
Flyinginanaeroplaneonasunnyday

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,200
Going to a
picnic a long

29
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,220
long way away

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,771
Goingtotheoutbackonasunnyday

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,740
Flying to the
outback a long

32
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,680
long way away

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,180
我係好鍾意內陸嗰度㗎

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100
不過內陸真喺邊度啊？

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,060
我哋而家就喺佢上面飛緊啊

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,560
噢

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,040
就噉睇好似一片山幕啊

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,100
就差唔多喇，不過內陸對我哋嚟講
都係一個好神奇嘅地方嚟㗎

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,700
我哋就喺呢度野餐喇

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
喺呢一棵特別嘅樹下面野餐

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,000
呢幾英里之內唯一嘅樹

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,560
呢度好熱啊

43
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,440
你哋有冇帶水嚟啊？

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,060
梗係有啦，大家都好需要水

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,040
喺內陸呢度水係好珍貴㗎
所以唔可以…嘩

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,240
真係好舒服啊

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,520
隨便浪費

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,040
爹哋

49
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,920
啲水係要嚟飲㗎

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,340
你唔應該亂咁倒咗佢哋㗎

51
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,490
噢

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,060
唔使擔心喎

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,300
我哋而家開始準備傳統
嘅澳洲內陸野餐啊

54
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,460
噢

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,500
聽落幾好喎

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,760
噉我哋係咪要執乾樹枝嚟生火啊？

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,460
唔使執乾樹枝啦

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,260
因為我哋有石油器啊

59
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,380
袋鼠先生有一個石油器燒烤爐

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,540
我哋嚟野餐嘅時候通常
都會見到鴨太太㗎

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,080
哈

62
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,180
喺呢片噉嘅沙漠中間係冇
可能會見到鴨太太啊

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,760
呢隻動物應該叫做鴨嘴獸

64
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,460
每次我哋嚟野餐嗰陣
成日都會見到鴨嘴獸太太經過

65
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,070
哈

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,480
已經燒好啦

67
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,500
大家快啲嚟食燒粟米啦

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,350
好嘢

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Pepper好鍾意食燒粟米

70
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,720
大家都好鍾意食燒粟米

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,680
我哋一齊嚟玩遊戲喇

72
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,520
好啊

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,960
玩喇

74
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,840
我帶咗板球棒嚟啊

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,020
噢

76
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,880
乜原來澳洲呢度都鍾意玩板球嘎？

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
咩叫澳洲呢度都玩板球？

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,580
我哋天生就係板球高手

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,590
板球

80
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,520
呢樣嘢係點玩㗎？

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,220
要用球棒打中板球

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,230
噢

83
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,600
如果我接住個波，噉你就出局㗎喇

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,620
Daddy準備喇

85
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,000
你出局喇，Daddy

86
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,040
好嘢

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,120
輪到你喇，Pepper

88
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,380
打得好好啊，Pepper

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
閉喇

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,100
個板球打咗上波樹上面

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
呢度周圍只有呢一波樹
估唔到個波都居然kick咗喺嗰度喎

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,840
等我抱你上去啦，Pepper

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,740
你睇唔睇？

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,660
睇到個波喺邊啊

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,080
呢度有隻啤啤熊捉食我哋個波啊

96
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,160
呢隻唔係啤啤熊嚟㗎，Pe pper

97
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,040
佢係一隻樹熊啊

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
唔該晒

99
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,480
呢隻小動物係我見過嘅
動物之中最可愛㗎

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,660
係嘅，你都一樣好可愛啊，鴨嘴獸太太

101
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,100
我係講真㗎

102
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,220
好啦，咁多位

103
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,520
夠鐘返屋企喇

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Pepper，今晚你就住我哋屋企喇

105
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,010
好耶

106
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,640
今日喺內陸野餐真係好好玩啊

107
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,400
我哋聽日可唔可以再去多次啊？

108
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,260
Pepper，你嚟到澳洲
仲有其他好嘅嘢可以做㗎

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
係噉就好啦

110
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,480
大家早唞

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,490
早唞

112
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,240

假期之後，Pepper同Ge
