1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,400
我叫做Peppa
而佢就係我細佬George，佢就係豬太太

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,980
佢係豬先生，我係Peppa

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,300
唔該同多謝

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,840
豬爺爺同豬媽媽喺Peppa屋企食早餐

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,560
媽咪，麻煩你增多一杯果汁畀我𠻹啊

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,080
好啊， Pepper，冇問題

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,330
唔該晒

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,300
吓，唔係嘛
報紙話而家啲細路仔好粗魯喎

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,400
George，要唔要啲果汁啊？

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,740
麻煩你，唔該晒

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,840
仲話啲細路好冇禮貌，唔講唔該同多謝

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,800
Pepper同George成日
都講唔該同多謝㗎，係咪啊？

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,180
係啊，爺爺

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,280
聽你哋噉講我就開心喇
唔該同多謝係兩個好重要嘅字眼嚟㗎

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,240
話你哋知佢哋係有魔法㗎

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,180
有魔法

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,000
哦，係啊，講唔該同多謝之後
好事就會發生

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,020
唔該…

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,880
George，唔係噉㗎
只會喺你有嘢麻煩人嗰陣先要唔該人㗎咋

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,480
又或者喺人哋幫咗你忙嗰陣
講唔該或者多謝

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,860
唔該唔該…

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,600
好…你哋係時候返幼兒園喇

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,020
你哋坐定定咩啊？

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,380
爹哋，坐好啦

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,900
噉我哋就出發喇

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,110
唔該

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,200
呢度係Peppa返學嘅幼兒園
牛先生喺度剪緊草

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,600
你將草地修剪得好好啊，牛先生

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,940
哦，多謝你啊，朱先生

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,680
各位小朋友，早晨啊

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
早晨啊，情人太太

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,340
等我嚟介紹一下，呢度有一棵友善樹

33
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,800
佢哋用嚟做乜嘢㗎？

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,680
當你哋對人哋友善嗰陣
我就會將你哋嘅想掛喺樹之上

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,330
哦

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,120
我哋點樣表現友善啊？

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,080
表現你哋嘅友善可以有好多方法

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,340
情人太太，我知道兩個可以表現友善嘅…

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,490
哦，係啊，有魔法嘅用語？

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,470
唔該你講畀我哋聽下

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,810
即係如果你要一啲嘢嘅時候
就要同人講唔該

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,890
不過如果有人畀嘢你嗰陣…

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,160
講得好

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,520
哦，我哋可以用玩遊戲嘅
形式嚟練習唔該同多謝

45
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:35,920
我需要兩個小朋友
麻煩Sus ie同埋Danny

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,940
而家Susie有一個蘋果

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,360
多謝情人太太

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,880
講得好啊，Susie
而D anny想要呢個蘋果喎

49
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,120
係啊，我想要呢個蘋果

50
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,340
好啦，Danny
問Susie要蘋果喇

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,180
畀個蘋果我得唔得啊？

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,150
好啊

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,200
好香啊

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,560
我哋試多一次啊，當你問人要嘢嘅時候
記得一定要講嗰個有魔法嘅字眼啊

55
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,100
阿布拉卡達布拉

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,020
唔係，小朋友，魔法字眼係乜嘢啊？

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,180
要講唔該？

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,340
哦，知道喇

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,560
準備好未啊？

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,580
準備好喇

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
得嘅就開始喇

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,620
唔該你畀個蘋果我，得唔得啊？

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,440
唔得

64
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,470
Susie？

65
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,300
佢已經有一個蘋果喇喎

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,800
重點唔喺蘋果度，而係學識講唔該啊

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,880
好啦，呢度仲有一個蘋果

68
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,080
噉Danny，要點講啊？

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,800
講咩啊？

70
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
另一個魔法字眼

71
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,780
哦，係喎

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,980
多謝你

73
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,180
做得好啊

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,940
少朋友，你哋唱得真係好好聽啊

75
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,000
你哋所有人嘅想，都可以掛喺友善樹上面

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,190
好耶

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,380

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,200
你唔記得同牛先生講魔法字眼喇

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,980
哦，係啊，我好冇禮貌啊

84

85
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,400
