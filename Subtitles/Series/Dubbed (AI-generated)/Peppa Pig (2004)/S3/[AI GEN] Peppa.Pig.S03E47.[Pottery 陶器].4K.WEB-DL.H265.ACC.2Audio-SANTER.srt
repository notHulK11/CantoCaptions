1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,290
我叫做Peppa

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,190
而佢就係我細佬George

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,330
佢就係豬太太

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,370
佢係豬先生

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,890
我係Peppa

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,130
淘氣

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Pepper同George
今日去咗Suey屋企玩

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,670
Susu同Sasa用
一啲黏土砌咗一座叢林

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,490
而George就用黏土砌咗一隻恐龍

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,610
Pepper同Suey
同啲公仔一齊玩野餐

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,530
你最近幾好啊，豪先生？

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,880
你口唔口？

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,870
想唔想飲茶？

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,290
豪先生話，好啊

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,510
豪先生，請問你知唔知暗號係乜嘢？

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,870
暗號係，唔該你

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,070
原來我哋呢度冇茶具喎

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,010
唔係問題啊
都係我哋用黏土砌一套茶具啊

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,960
係嘩

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,950
George
你哋可唔可以借啲黏土畀我哋啊？

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,220
唔得

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,310
Susu，Sasa
唔該你哋幫下手喇，我哋要砌一套茶具沖茶飲啊

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,480
唔得

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,070
其實你哋可以幫我哋砌㗎喎

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,610
我就會整一個茶壺

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,430
我哋一人整一隻杯啊

27
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,050
睇下，噉有豪先生就有茶飲喇

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,490
哦，呢個茶壺唔夠硬脹喎

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,290
真正嘅茶壺一定唔會噉㗎

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,110
我知啊，我媽咪會整真正嘅茶壺
因為佢識得整陶器㗎

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,250
媽咪，我哋需要一套茶具
你可唔可以幫我哋整吖？

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,510
要有茶壺同埋茶杯

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,330
因為我哋要用佢嚟沖茶飲啊

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,110
好啊，跟我嚟啊

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,290
呢度就係斑馬太太整陶器嘅地方

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,470
我哋而家開始整茶具喇

37
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,050
呢啲係咩嚟㗎？

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,350
係黏土，所有陶器都係由佢整出嚟㗎

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,770
佢軟淋淋㗎，好似我哋玩嘅黏土啊

40
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,130
因為佢噉軟，我哋只可以整造型

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,510
等佢乾咗之後就會變硬㗎喇

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,410
斑馬太太開始喺個轉盤上面整茶杯

43
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,530
搞掂，一隻茶杯

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,030
照噉睇真係幾容易整㗎喎

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,710
你想唔想試下整啊？

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,050
我梗係想啦

47
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,050
摸落去滑散散噉嘅

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,340
喺個轉盤上面整茶杯
真係一啲都唔容易㗎

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,640
要整茶杯有更加簡單嘅方法㗎

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,920
首先將啲黏土搓到好似條好
長嘅蟲仔噉，好似噉樣

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
佢睇落好似一條魚蟲啊

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,820
I'm a wrinkly worm

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,060
I'm a wrinkly worm

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm made of clay

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,400
What shall I
make today？

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,660
I'm a wrinkly worm

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,280
跟住就要將佢不停噉搖圈

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
但係睇落有少少粒凸喎

59
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,900
唔緊要嘅，而家我就用手整滑佢

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
跟住幫佢加隻杯柄

61
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,520
茶杯完成喇

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,320
噉即係我哋有兩隻茶杯喇

63
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,220
係啊，但係一套茶具唔
單止有兩隻茶杯㗎喎

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,480
我哋整多幾隻茶杯喇

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,390
好啊

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,670
恐龍

67
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,200
George佢又整多一隻恐龍喇

68
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,640
George佢成日都
淨係識得整恐龍㗎咋

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
你隻恐龍好得人驚喎

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,420
而家我哋就要將啲茶具擺入個窯嗰度先

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,820
其實窯係一個可以將黏土焗到變硬嘅燒爐

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,000
套茶具應該整好啦

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,990
好嘢

74
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,040
跟住就要上顏色

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,520
大家而家喺度幫啲茶具
上緊一啲鮮豔嘅顏色

76
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,360
套茶具終於完成喇

77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,960
完成喇，我哋而家可以沖茶飲喇

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,740
冇錯，個個都有一隻茶杯

79
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,400
畢喇，我哋唔記得咗整茶壺喎

80
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:21,620
有辦法喇，我哋可以用
George整出嚟嘅恐龍檔茶壺嘅嘛

81
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,800
冇錯，我哋裝啲水入去先喇

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,300
我覺得呢一套係世界上最好嘅茶具喇

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,600
梗係喇，個個都知道最好嘅茶具
一定要有一隻恐龍喺入邊㗎

84
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,930
茶壺

85
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,100
