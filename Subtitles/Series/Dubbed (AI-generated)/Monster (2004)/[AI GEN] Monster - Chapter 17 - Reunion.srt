1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,320
她在那裏有寶寶
而紐納茲正在計劃把城市燒掉

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,640
一個土耳其女子被發現在第三樓死亡

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,360
我們正在接觸約會嘅地方，約翰會在等你

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,560
我不確定會發生什麼事

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,860
你知道怎麼使用那枚槍吧？

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,060
嗯？

7
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:37,180
蛤？

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,220
凱爾文街，佛洛克，現在

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
我們嘅計劃改變了

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,620
為何突然變了心？

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,980
為何要殺亂約翰？

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,620
我稍後會處理他，現在就這麼説吧

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,460
總統洛夫會很失望地聽到這個消息

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,700
他個人要求你殺亂約翰

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,020
他相信你是工作人員

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,040
我不在乎

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,820
我不會接受任何人嘅要求

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,440
我會自行殺亂約翰

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,780
現在趕快到凱爾文街去吧

20
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,790
凱爾文街

21
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,070
要求你殺亂約翰

22
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,450
現在是時候教他一項課程了

23
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,970
這地方無論如何都會燒焦

24
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,570
讓他們留在這裏等着燒焦

25
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,260
救命啊

26
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,490
別哭了，小子，唔好哭了

27
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,050
你媽媽很快就會回來

28
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,900
艾謝

29
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,600
我…

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,380
我不敢相信你還活着

31
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
你找到我了嘛？

32
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,160
這是因為迪達嘅事
他告訴我你住在這裏，你説了迪達？

33
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,800
那就説了你那天跟我説嘅天馬男人了

34
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
迪達在哪？

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,060
他沒來過嘛？

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
呃…沒有

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,220
那他去哪了？

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,260
你看見了艾謝嘛？

39
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,900
這孩子是艾謝嘅小孩

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,120
他很想她，他很想他嘅媽媽

41
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,300
也不可能…不，這不可能

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,540
我不相信

43
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,700
這小子真可憐

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
他太年輕了，卻沒有母親

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,920
我要做什麼？

46
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,400
我要做什麼？

47
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,120
她是最後嘅

48
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,560
必須沒有其他犯人

49
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,920
現在我必須見到現在嘅特區領導人

50
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,860
大家有什麼想法？

51
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,540
把城市燒焦了？

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,620
不可能

53
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,580
我們經常聽到謊言關於右派極端人

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,040
我們冇法反對他們每次威脅我們

55
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,691
更令我驚訝嘅是這位日本人在這裏跳舞
雖然他説自己嘅性命在危險中

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,740
你們倆怎麼回事？

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,980
艾謝死了

58
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,850
你們不明白嘛？

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
她死了是因為她嘗試提醒
我們所有人這個危險

60
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,280
我也有疑問

61
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,840
她像你一樣是個女人吧？

62
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,920
你們女人經常和德國人分手
但卻失去了一切，這不是新事物

63
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,400
你們把我們土耳其人都弄壞了

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,660
無論如何
我們都不知道那個人是誰嘅孩子

65
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,180
你們都知道生命是很困難嘅事
你們應該知道比噉樣做更好

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,920
如果你們想要生命
你們必須要聽我嘅話

67
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,050
忘了

68
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,100
做你想要嘅事

69
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,600
你們可以燒掉，去死吧

70
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,530
無論如何都好

71
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,340
現在等一等

72
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,980
你們在推薦軍隊嘛？

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,660
也許我們應該按照這位日本人所説嘅做
我們沒有什麼失去嘅

74
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,720
Mr， Deniz
你們真嘅會聽一啲我們不認識嘅亞洲人嘛？

75
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,980
他可能有點懷疑
但是世界上有很多有信心嘅日本人

76
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,680
例如，總統諾基

77
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,940
總統諾基？

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,820
他是誰？

79
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,080
你説你不認識他嘛？

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,631
總統諾基是一名勇敢嘅日本人
他們在歐洲失敗時拯救了土耳其軍隊

81
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,590
哦

82
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,895
馬上去收拾我們所有嘅軍人
馬上去收拾我們所有嘅軍人

83
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,500
看起來真好吃

84
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,440
咱們進去吧

85
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,640
不必急着，女士們

86
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,530
請慢用時間

87
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,340
我們不想要吃完，才可以享受娛樂

88
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,080
我已經計劃好
當主題嘅演出結束後，演出將會達到尾聲

89
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,660
同時，我們來享受這76座嘅旅遊
我特地為了這晚嘅節奏

90
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,940
Mmm， the
first dish we will

91
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,180
indul ge in is
my favorite， raw

92
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,040
fl ounder
with caviar

93
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,560
Mmm…

94
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,040
And as the
feast begins…

95
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,130
哦

96
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,880
Voila
the first fire

97
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,760
What a
wonderful start

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,860
But like I
told you， that's

99
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
still just
an appetizer

100
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,260
Where is the
main course？

101
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,320
Remember
what I said

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,340
Don't be impatient

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,900
如果你喜歡吃飯
我嘅節目會是你真正嘅喜悦

104
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,060
告訴我主要嘅項目在哪兒？

105
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,220
如果那是一個飲料，那你會燒什麼？

106
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
我們需要更多火炎炸彈

107
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,280
我們要分開，其餘嘅男人跟我來

108
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,720
正如我所想，火炎開始了

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
這整個地方都會爆炸

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
三個團隊，救女生和孩子

111
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,820
我嘅真是個美麗嘅驚喜

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,560
為何我們要這個尊貴呢？

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,840
為何你…別嘗試了

114
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,860
還是跟你老闆説再見吧

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
把那個危險嘅東西放下吧

116
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,525
為何我們不一起享受這頓飯呢？

117
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,140
可惜嘅是，你嘅飲料嘅味道不太好

118
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,240
別擔心，那只是一開始而已

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,540
這就係你最愛嘅吧？

120
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,310
對唔住

121
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,180
別這麼反對，寶貝

122
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,600
你看，畢竟這是一場
美麗嘅慶祝，為了約翰

123
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,660
聽我講，約翰不想有任何這種事

124
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,990
哦？

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,660
告訴我，你怎麼這麼肯定呢？

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,800
我看到了，用自己嘅眼睛

127
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,611
我跟隨他嘅訊息，我知道他想要什麼

128
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,420
約翰不在乎你嘅計劃

129
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,080
所以，你到底看到了什麼？

130
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,740
約翰…

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,400
他不想有任何這種事，你明白嘛？

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,260
沒問題，放鬆一下…放輕鬆一點

133
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,160
約翰死了是因為你

134
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,380
今晚，我不會讓任何人都死

135
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,220
所以，你到底想要做什麼？

136
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,060
你想要在什麼地方開火？

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,870
糟糕

138
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,020
開火了

139
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,700
開火了

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,670
開火了

141
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,820
把受害人帶到醫院，我在那裏

142
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,210
天馬

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,660
你找到了彼得嘛？

144
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,160
有人告訴我，他們看到了一個像
他那樣嘅小孩，在午夜嘅旁邊

145
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,980
彼得，我嘅

146
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,930
嘿

147
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,330
我們唔好跟着她，再把她帶回來嘛？

148
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,430
不，我們繼續吃午餐吧

149
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,650
那個女人確實是…我猜她應該是在家裏嘅

150
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,550
她嘅眼睛…

151
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,970
她真嘅想要把我殺了

152
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,630
幸好她還沒發現
我很快就給她了主要嘅位置

153
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,190
那，我們要去拿下一道菜了嘛？

154
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,610
不，先給我一點衣服

155
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,430
她真是個可怕嘅女孩

156
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,360
你做到了

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,780
你會好好，雙方都行，好嘛？

158
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,180
她聽不到你是誰，王女，但謝謝我放逃嘅

159
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,040
你倆acaba到那裏？

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
咦，我…

161
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,460
女士，你想知道出了什麼事？

162
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,100
這個傢伙把我連殺了

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,320
忘了這是什麼，我要趕到這兒了

164
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,320
如果那是那個少嘅打火機穿衣雞
我不會太驚訝

165
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:26,540
這是第二句話

166
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,600
這是第三句話

167
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,980
I won't have
any more victims

168
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,040
not one more

169
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,180
我不會有更多嘅犧牲，再也沒有一個

170
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,780
Wait，whatareyoutalkingabout？

171
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,131
Well，thewind'
sgonnachangedirection

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,900
It always
happens every

173
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,280
night around
this time， the

174
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,140
wind just stops

175
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,700
Then it starts
blowing towards

176
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,140
town from
where the river is

177
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,110
然後它就開始向城市飛來

178
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,550
The wind…
it stopped

179
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,361
風…它停了

180
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,290
And now…現在…

181
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,010
…it's time
for the main

182
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,350
course to
be served

183
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,700
時間讓主隊服務

184
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,550
Did you see
them running away？

185
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:05,830
你看到他們跑掉了嘛？

186
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,750
Allow me to
buy this round

187
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,530
Okay，thatshouldtakecareofit

188
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:10,790
好嘅，這應該要照顧好

What are you
talking about？

192
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:15,710
你在説什麼呢？

193
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,070
Youhavetotakeiteasyforawhile

199
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:32,450
沒錯，謝謝你
我們可以把那啲火炎放出嚟，救了隔壁

00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,470

你不可underestimatetheTurks

202

Where are they t
ending to all of

203
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:37,310
the other
injured people？

204
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,930
The mosque
by the river

205
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,120
在河裏嘅墓堂

206
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,270
Hey，Dr，Tenma
takeabreakandrelax

207
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:43,590
來吧，天馬醫生，休息一下

208
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:44,630
Come on
why don 't you have a

209
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,381
drink with us？

210
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:45,470
來吧，為何不給我們喝一杯？

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,781
Notuntileveryone'stakencareof

212
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,620
不至於所有人都被照顧了

213
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,530
If all of the
fires up until

214
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,070
now were just
diversions，如果所有

215
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:52,730
火炎到現在都只是偷渡
where do you

216
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,490
think they're
going to light

217
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:54,241
the real fire？

218
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:54,570
你覺得他們會把真正嘅火炎燒到哪裏來？

219
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,750
How the hell
would I know？

220
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,530
我怎麼知道呢？

221
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:56,890
I don 't give a
shit about this

222
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:57,890
stupid town anyway

223
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,130
我也不關心這個愚蠢嘅城市

224
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,190
Besides
there's something much

225
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,490
more important
on my mind that

226
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:02,815
I gotta
take care of

227
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,030
除此之外，我必須要照顧更
重要嘅事情，Wait

228
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,910
I need you to
tell me， and I

229
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,930
need you to
tell me now

230
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,430
我必須要你告訴我現在

231
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,430
Where would you
start the real

232
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:08,181
fire？

233
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,610
Get your
hands off of me

234
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:11,650
Like I already
told you， the

235
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,401
wind'sgonnacomefromtheriver

236
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:26,330
像我已經告訴過你，風會從河

237
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,031
裏來，Listento？

238
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,451
Yes，thisisgoingtobedelicious

239
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:39,650
聽聽看…是嘅，這會很美味

240
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,690
We 're right
on schedule

241
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:43,010
The celebration of the master

242
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,410
race is
about to begin

243
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,560
聖戰嘅慶祝快要開始了

244
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,950
It's you

245
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,990
Why did you
follow me？

246
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,330
你嚟？

247
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:07,361
BecauseIhavetoputoutthefire

248
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,830
I made a
promise to Tenma

249
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:09,741
我答應了天馬

250
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,190
Tenma…天馬…

251
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,760
This is it

252
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:21,880
這就係它

253
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,960
It's the warehouse

254
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,700
這就係廠房

255
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:25,451
Thank goodness

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,120
Looks like
they haven't found

257
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:27,871
this place yet

258
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,892
謝謝睇嚟他們還沒找到這裏

259
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,220
These are
all filled with

260
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:30,971
chemicals？

261
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,680
If all of this
were to go up

262
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,450
it'd be hopeless

263
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,400
There'dbenothingleftofthetown

264
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,880
I'll protect
this place no

265
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:38,480
matter what

266
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm not
gonna let those

267
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,020
horrible
people burn it down

268
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,440
Are you okay？

269
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,391
I slipped

270
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,330
我掉了

271
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,020
What the
heck is this？

272
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,310
這是什麼東西？

273
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,740
It smells
like gasoline

274
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,491
聞起來像汽油

275
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,160
It looks like…
someone's there

276
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,140
看起來…有人在那裏
It'salright

277
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,090
I'm fine

278
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,860
I can walk
on my own

279
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:07,620
Let's get you
to a shelter so I

280
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:08,780
canhaveacloserlookatit

281
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,320
I twisted my ankle

282
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,960
It probably
happened when I

283
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,911
wastryingtogetawayfromthefire

284
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,500
我彎了我嘅腳，我可能是想要離開火嘅事

285
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,420
Now that I
finally got this

286
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,180
rug， who gives a
damn about this

287
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,030
stink in' town？

288
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,900
I bet I can
probably get

289
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,540
800，000 marks
for this baby

290
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,520
No， a million

291
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,960
我想我可能可以給這孩子800
000分，不，10000

292
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:26,340
Heckle

293
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,190
Heckle

294
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,490
What happened to Dieter？

295
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,290
What happened to Dieter？

296
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,041
Couldn 't say

297
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,170
He'sprobably…
呃，不能説，他可能…

298
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:36,590
Where is he？

299
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,130
Where'd he go？

300
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,110
What happened to him？

301
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:38,910
他在哪裏？

302
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,690
Last I saw
he was going to the

303
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,681
abandonedwarehousebytheriver

304
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,390
最後我看見，他在海邊嘅遺産中間走過了
Whythere？

305
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,650
The wind's gonna
blow in from the

306
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:46,401
river soon

307
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,870
海邊嘅風將會馬上吹進
Soifthechemicalsin

308
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,370
that warehouse
are set on fire

309
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,810
it's all over
for this town

310
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,025
所以如果那間沙發中的化石都放在火上
這城市就全都完了

311
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:57,310
ThisiswhatIwastalkingabout

312
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,400
這就係我所説嘅

313
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,570
Tell everyone
to evacuate from

314
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:02,110
theriversidesheltersrightaway

315
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,100
Go

316
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,920
Go

317
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,770
You 're going
to take me there

318
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,350
你們要帶我去

319
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:11,360
Who is it？

320
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,160
Who's back there？

321
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,770
Who

322
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,390
is it？

323
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,430
Can it be true？

324
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,750
Are you really
Johan's sister？

325
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,090
是真嘅嘛？

326
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,210
Put the
lighter down now

327
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,420
把燈燈放下

328
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,370
Once I set
this trail of

329
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,470
gasoline on
fire， this

330
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,090
warehouse is
going to go up

331
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:44,841
in an instant

332
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:46,490
I'm going to
shoot you in the

333
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,550
head before
that happens

334
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,030
我會先把你射到頭來

335
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,170
I can fire
quicker than you

336
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,310
can flick that
lighter， and I'm

337
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:51,330
not afraid to do it

338
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,650
我可以比你射得更快，而且我不會害怕

339
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,610
And what
if you miss？

340
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,050
你會失敗嘛？

341
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,250
I haven't
skipped a day of

342
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:55,670
training in six
months straight

343
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,010
soIknowIcanhityoufromhere

344
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:00,430
You don't
fright en me

345
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,730
Don't you know？

346
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,230
This is a
celebration of

347
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,080
the master race

348
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,550
你不怕我嘛？

349
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,170
ThisisourbigwelcomeforJohan

350
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,330
But Johan doesn
't want any of

351
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,190
the things you want

352
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,235
但Johan不想要你想要嘅東西

353
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,130
Yes， it's
true that he was

354
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,001
recentlyseenhereinFrankfurt

355
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,330
是嘅，他在這裏最近被看到了

356
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,610
And all of
his subordinates

357
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,470
He left a
message behind

358
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,400
you know

359
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,110
他還留下了一個信息，你知道嘛？

360
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:22,861
What message？

361
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,890
Listen to me

362
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,701
Johanisnotthepersonyouthinkheis

363
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,950
The truth
is much more

364
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,050
complex than that

365
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,350
What are you
trying to say？

366
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:31,790
你在説什麼？

367
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,541
It's worse

368
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,770
Itmustbeterrifyingforhim

369
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,010
He's suffering

370
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,810
He's in anguish
and teetering on

371
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:38,610
the edge
of despair

372
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,532
更糟糕嘅是，他在痛苦中，在悲哀中

373
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,310
You know
I'm not so sure it's

374
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,390
such a good
idea to be making

375
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,510
enemies of
these guys

376
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,940
你知道，我不太確定這是這麼好嘅主意

377
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,530
I didn't sign on
for all of this

378
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,490
I'm going to
call it a day

379
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:53,910
See ya

380
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,230
我還沒結帳，再見

381
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:55,170
Where the hell
do you think you

382
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:55,470
're going？

383
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,650
Where the hell
do you think you

384
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:56,590
Are you just
going to let

385
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,570
Diet er die
like that？

386
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,930
Tellmewherethewarehouseis

387
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,190
你到底想要讓彼得死嘛？

388
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,010
Alright
I'll tell you

389
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,470
I'll tell you

390
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,330
Just let me go

391
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,230
You're choking me

392
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,450
好啦，我會告訴你…讓我走，你在騙我

393
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,770
Youtoldmeaboutyourfriend

394
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,810
YousaidthathisnameisTenma，right？

395
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,290
你告訴我你朋友嘅事
你説他嘅名字叫Tenma，對嘛？

396
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,070
Would you
believe that I

397
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,301
knowamanwhosenameisTenmaalso？

398
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,090
你相信我也知道他嘅名字
叫Ten ma嘛？

399
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:15,841
Yes

400
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,070
But he must
never fire a

401
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:20,361
gun，notifIcandoitforhim

402
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,710
沒錯，但他必須不會用槍
如果我能做到嘅話，就不行了

403
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:21,870
I don't want
him to kill anyone

404
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,810
He's a good man

405
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,690
我不想他殺人，他是個好人

406
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:25,090
K illing people
is always wrong

407
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,920
you understand？

408
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,950
Even if they'
re the bad guys？

409
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:29,001
Right

410
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,230
Don'teverdowhatI'mabouttodo

411
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,145
沒錯，別再做我現在要做嘅事

412
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,290
Close your eyes

413
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,170
Don't look

414
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,181
別看

415
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,210
Don't shoot

416
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,320
別開槍

417
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,170
Tenma

418
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,650

Quick，Hekko

420
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:57,900
快啲，Hekko，開火

421
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:59,040
And use the
rock， hurry

422
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,670
No

423
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,160
Not the rock

424
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,030
Not the rock

425
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,400
不用石頭

426
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,520
One million

427
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,590
marks

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,750
Gone

429
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,250
一百萬，沒了

430
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,340
Nina

431
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,170
妮娜

天馬

434
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Damn it， all the
cops are coming

435
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,071
Get out， go

436
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,620
I'll take care
of things here

437
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:38,600
我來處理事情，There'
saboatoverbytheriver

438
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,111
河裏有一艘船，Please
Tenma，youhavetoleavenow

439
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,675
拜託，天馬，你現在就要離開了

440
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,140
My main course
it got cold

441
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,310
我嘅主船，它變冷了

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,280
Thank you
for all your

443
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:03,440
cooperation
young lady

444
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,720
謝謝你所有嘅協力，女士

445
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,240
We'd appreciate
it if you'd come

446
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,000
down to
the station

447
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,200
我們會很感激你下船

448
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,920
Wait one second
okay？

449
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,770
I'll be right back

450
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,240
等一下，我馬上回來
Hey，holdon

451
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,260
You have

452
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,560
to promise me
something， Nina

453
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,351
Sweartomeyouwon'tkillanyone

454
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,520
I saw it

455
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,380
I saw Yohan
's message

456
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,291
I saw it， too

457
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm heading there now

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,280
我也看到了

459
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,000
Ten years ago
the night I shot

460
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,600
my brother
十年前，那天我叫了我兄弟

461
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,440
I finally know
what he meant

462
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,860
when he told me
to shoot him in

463
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:46,220
the head

464
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:46,840
我終於知道他想要把他打死嘅意思了

465
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:47,640
Now I understand

466
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,970
現在我明白了

467
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,160
Yohan
he's not alone

468
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,320
There are two
of him inside

469
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,350
Yohan，他不是獨自嘅

470
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,740
That's why， Dr
Tenma， it wasn't

471
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:11,491
your fault

472
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,200
你是為了什麼

473
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,260
You didn't do
anything wrong

474
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,860
你沒做錯

475
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,440
I must do it

476
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,640
我必須做

477
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,640
I have no
other choice

478
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,610
我沒有其他選擇

479
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,340
I have to
shoot Yohan again

480
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,150
我必須再次殺Yohan

481
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,290
Hey

482
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,470
wait up

483
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,521
Whatthehellarewedoinghereanyway？

484
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,490
Come on
let's get out of here

485
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,110
來吧，我們出去吧

486
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:42,230
Thanks

487
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:42,870
I give up

488
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,710
There's no use
with this guy

489
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,430
不用再給他打死了

490
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,370
I guess he'll
be starving and

491
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,121
broke forever

492
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,510
我猜他會餓死了

493
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:50,110
If only I
still had that rug

494
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,170
Damn it

495
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:59,001
Whatthehellisthatsupposedtobe？

496
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,450
It's a message

497
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,220
它是一個訊息

498
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,940
Help

499
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:18,300
The monster
inside me is

500
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:19,740
about to explode

501
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:20,691
我嘅裏面嘅怪物快要爆炸了

502
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,140
Whatisthissupposedtomean？

503
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,200
He has a
split personality？

504
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,250
這是什麼意思呢？

505
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:43,001
他有個分屬性嘛？
