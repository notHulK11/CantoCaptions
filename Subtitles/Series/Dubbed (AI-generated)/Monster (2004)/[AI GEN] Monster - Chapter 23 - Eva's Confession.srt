00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,980
You wake up

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,180
Leave me alone

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,780
Yeah， like that
's gonna happen

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,080
Now get up

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,040
Come on
this isn't a hotel

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,020
Don't touch me

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,200
How dare you

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,220
Do you have any
idea who I am？

10
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,290
Alright

11
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,931
Here'sallthestuffyoucameinwith

can sign here

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
Miss Heinemann
I don't ever

15
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,160
want to see
you tossed in the

16
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,720
cooler again
passing out

17
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,520
drunk， alone
in a dark alley

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,740
Be thankful something

19
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,180
horrible didn'
t happen to you

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
You got a
cigarette？

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,110
Huh？

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm just asking
if you've got a

23
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,431
cigarette

24
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,980

My bag

Iwanttoknowwhatyoudidwithmybag

29
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,980
And I already
told you it's

30
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:09,980
the only
bag you had

31
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,010
You liar

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,100
I know you're
not telling me

33
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,460
the truth

34
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,780
I had another
shoulder bag

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,630
Where is it？

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,140
Probably with
whoever stole it

37
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,220
from you when
you passed out

38
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:18,060
drunk in the alley

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Whatareyougoingtodoaboutit？

40
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,400
I had valuables
important things

41
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,151
in there

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Tell you what

43
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,360
You can fill
out a theft report

44
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,111
if you like

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,180
But I really
wouldn't get

46
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:28,931
your hopes up

47
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,741

What？

52
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,330
What
happened here？

53
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,920
Damn

54
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,970
Somebody
really went to town

55
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,730
Oh man
this is awful

56
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,670
I gotta

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,930
The deposit
you put down has

61
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:07,850
already run out

62
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,270
I'm gonna need
the rest of what

63
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,021
you owe soon

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,690
These people
even broke into

65
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,490
my damn suitcase

66
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,010
Are you listening？

67
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,190
You have to pay
for a new lock

68
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,490
and all
that back rent

69
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,290
Well， I don't
have any money

70
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,380
What？

71
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,210
Fine， I'll get out

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't worry

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,130
Fine， I'll get out

74
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:29,881
It's a big story

75
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,170
But still
I don 't know what you

76
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,850
expect me to do
about any of it

77
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,850
You know
I seem to remember you

That'sallancienthistorynow

81
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,470
So why not
buy me a drink？

82
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,650
Please， Eva

83
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,201
It'sjustastolenpurseforGod'ssake

84
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,670
You must have
had some extra

85
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,930
cash tucked
away somewhere

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,530
Honestly
I've yet to meet

87
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,630
another woman
who could burn

88
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,730
through money
the way you do

89
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,610
And here you are
finally

90
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,150
coming to me
for some cash

91
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,270
This is it

92
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,110
Welcome to Rome

93
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,930
Rock bottom， baby

94
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,990
So how much？

95
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,270
I'll sleep
with you， you know

96
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,210
I'm asking you
how much you'd

97
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:07,961
be willing to pay

98
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,790
My God

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,530
Honey， as a
general rule

100
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,233
most men won't
pay to have sex

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,310
with women they
've already had

102
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,061
a bunch of times

103
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,790
You can at
least buy me a drink

104
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,810
Go find yourself
a street corner

105
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,561
to work

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,430
Who knows？

107
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,490
You might get
lucky and meet

108
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,521
somesadsackwho
'snottoopicky

109
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,510
A man who's
aged and drunk

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,810
must be
someone 's type

111
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,800
Positive

112
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,200
you didn't
leave any purse here

113
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:13,951
last night

114
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,620
Maybe you left
it wherever you

115
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,371
went next

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,080
I don't remember
anything after I

117
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:18,831
left this box

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,060
You mentioned you had

119
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,620
somethingimportantinyourbag

120
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,480
If it's worth
any money， you

121
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,760
might as well
kiss it goodbye

122
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,780
No， it's not

123
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,380
It's not worth
anything at all

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,800
Not any money
that is

125
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,530
Hey

126
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,010
I've been
looking for you

127
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,580
I asked for you
at the pub back

128
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:46,331
there

129
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,760
And they told
me you'd just

130
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:48,700
headed in
this direction

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,680
Yeah， and
who are you？

132
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,880
Are you serious？

133
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,740
We had such
a good time

134
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,720
drinking
last night

135
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,640
I was drinking with you？

136
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,240
Your bag

137
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,900
That's why I was
looking for you

138
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,660
I guess this
means I have to

139
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,691
makeawkwardintroductionsagain？

140
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,140
I 'm Roberto

141
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,560
So， shall we
grab a little

142
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,311
something to eat？

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,460
Your hotel room

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,590
Really？

145
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,620
That's terrible

146
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm so sorry

147
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,570
Well， whatever

148
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,180
I mean， it's not
like you did it

149
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,420
Well， no

150
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,290
Obviously not

154
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,380
A little
late for those

155
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,120
I don't need
them anymore

156
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,220
I'm sorry

157
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
It's all my fault

158
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
If I'd returned
your bag sooner

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,800
you wouldn't
have been kicked

160
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:36,880
out of your
room in the first

161
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:37,220

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,571
Hey，itwasn'

Besides
I'm very grateful

164
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,780
that you gave
me back my bag

165
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,920
Honestly
I'm kinda grateful

166
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:46,840
that you lost it

167
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,690
Huh？

168
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,300
Well， last night
as I watched you

169
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,600
leave the pub
I sat there

170
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,860
thinking to
myself， you

171
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,240
shouldn 't let
this person slip

172
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:54,991
away

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,660
And now
thanks to your bag

174
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,700
here you are
and here I am

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,510
Hm

176
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:01,260
You have

178
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,590
I do

179
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,580
This is all
that I have left in

180
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,331
the world

181
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh， a photo album

182
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,360
May I take a look？

183
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,330
You may

184
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,280
Hm

185
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,030
That's my father

186
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,650
He looks just
like I imagined

187
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,810
Hewasahospitaldirector，right？

188
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,310
Yeah

189
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,070
Did I talk about
him last night？

190
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,020
You did

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,810
You spoke very
highly of him

192
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,670
You mentioned
that he died ten

193
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,230
years ago

194
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,561
Icouldtellthatyoustillmisshim

195
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,500
Let's see

196
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,380
Ah

197
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,470
The exfiancé

198
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,870
Please， don't
tell me I told

199
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:46,621
you about him

200
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,250
I believe his
name was Tenma？

201
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,470
Quite a guy
this Tenma

202
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,410
I really want to
know what I said

203
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,161
last night

204
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,970
Well，Iwouldn'
tmakeahabitofit

205
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,050
It might end up
making other men

206
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:00,801
jealous

207
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,470
Huh？

208
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:04,910
Odd

209
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,070
This page is empty

210
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,630
Is that so？

211
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,750
The photos
that were on this

212
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,101
pagelookslikesomebodytorethemout

213
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,910
Well， I guess
I didn't need

214
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,870
those
pictures anymore

215
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,430
So I see

216
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,830
Hey

217
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,940
Hm？

218
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,510
Let's get a drink

219
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,710
Sounds good

220
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,680
So， you
were running a

221
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:33,500
security company

222
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm impressed

223
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,910
Yeah

224
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,280
In the
south of France

225
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,200
Then we had a
bad day， and one

226
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,360
of our
better clients was

227
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:44,380
killed on my watch

228
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,220
So， that was
the end of that

229
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,680
We're both
going through tough

230
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,431
times

231
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,640
Nah， forget it

232
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,860
Let'sdrinktothehereandnow

233
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,620
Enjoy ourselves
you know？

234
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:55,540
Mhm

235
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,340
That song

236
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,130
It's good stuff
huh？

237
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,470
So you like
this song too？

238
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,500
Course

239
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,570
Let's dance

240
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:22,860
Come on

241
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,831
Well，Idon'
treallyknowhowtodance

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,940
Just put your
arms around me

243
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,930
Um…

244
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Good

245
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:37,820
I knew a man who
loved this song

246
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,531
Hewasn'taverygooddancereither

247
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,571
So，you'dendupdancinglikethis？

248
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
That's right

249
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,040
How fun

250
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,060
How about
another drink？

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,340
Just one more？

252
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,680
Thanks
but I'm good

253
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,440
Lightweight

254
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,720
Time for bed

255
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,240
Sounds good
to me， babe

256
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,260
There's just
one more thing I

257
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,011
want to ask you

258
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,320
What's that？

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
The pictures

260
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Where are they？

261
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
What pictures？

262
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,830
The pictures

263
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:36,581
Those
photographs you

264
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,390
took out of the
album， where'd

265
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:39,141
you hide them？

266
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,690
Tell me

267
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,421
Yousee，I'

You'relookingforTenma，aren'tyou？

269
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,950
I know you
kept those photos

270
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,410
from burning
and I'm sure you

271
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,530
have them with
you somewhere

272
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,720
What？

273
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,230
You know what
you 're saying？

274
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,970
You know
where Tenma is？

275
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,100
Yeah

276
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,870
The photographs that you're

277
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:11,230
talking about
they're the ones

278
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,641

279
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,870
Joh an， wasn't it？

280
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,530
I've seen him
you know

281
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,310
Blonde， charming

282
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,970
handsome

283
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,590
He's grown up well

284
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,321
IsawhimayearagoinDusseldorf

285
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,300
Ken zo

286
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,520
Let's start over

287
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,200
You…

288
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,240
You need me

289
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,120
Kenzo

290
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,330
You belong to me

291
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,380
You belong to me

292
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,400
You belong to me

293
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,590
I will
get you back

294
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,600
I will
get you back

295
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,490
Because
you're mine

296
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,530
So，whatareyouuptothesedays？

297
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,470
I 've heard all
sorts of rumors

298
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,210
The rumors are
probably true

299
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,770
I've been
married and

300
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,030
divorced
three times now

301
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,730
Between
my father's

302
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,410
inheritance and
my alimony， I'm

303
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:22,350
living
pretty comfortably

304
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,090
But enough about me

305
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,110
How has life
been treating

306
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:25,930
you， Dr， Becker？

307
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:26,510
Huh？

308
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,910
I don't know

309
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,670
Nothing's
changed with me

310
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,370
I still have no
chance of moving

311
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,121
up in the world

312
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:33,930
Speaking of which
Tenma's

313
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,970
now chief
of surgery

314
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,570
Word is he's
on his way to

315
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:37,881
becominghospitaldirector

316
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,350
Love to be in
his shoes， let

317
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,101
me tell you

318
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,810
But please
who am I kidding？

319
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,950
It ain't so bad

320
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,110
Istillmanagetohaveagoodtime

321
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,930
There'smoretolifethanpromotions

322
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,750
I 'd never want
to be like Tenma

323
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,190
andhavenotimeforwomenorfun

324
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,310
What's the point？

325
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,990
Is Kenzo…

326
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,210
Do you know by
any chance if

327
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,850
Dr， Tenma ever
did settle down？

328
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,050
No， not yet

329
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,990
And to be
completely

330
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,470
honest
there are two very

331
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,110
nice women

332
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,690
But you know him
no interest

333
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:06,090
at all

334
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,150
His work
comes first

335
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,730
As a matter of
fact， I'm about

336
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,130
to set him up
with a new girl

337
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,590
God only knows
if it's gonna

338
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,341
work out

339
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,490
She's the
daughter of a

340
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:15,790
state senator and she is

341
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,390
absolutely
beautiful

342
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,050
If she can'
t keep his

343
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:20,210
attention
then I give up

344
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,110
But anyway
you called me about

345
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:23,410
something

346
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,390
How can I be
of service， Eva？

347
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,570
You know
back when you were

348
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:28,490
the daughter
of the hospital

349
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,190
director
you never even gave

350
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:30,950
me the time of day

351
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:33,070
Who would have
thought that you

352
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:33,930
'd even
think to call？

353
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,550
I understand
you 're well off

354
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,730
But really
I think you're

355
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:40,530
getting lonely
aren't you？

356
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,430
I mean it when
I say it， Eva

357
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,701
I'mmorethanhappytolistenanytime

358
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,270
Look， I don't
want you to let

359
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:48,021
them meet up

360
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,330
Dr， Tenma
and the state

361
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,190
senator's daughter

362
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,710
Don't let
him meet her

363
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,750
Man， I
should have known

364
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,710
You're still
in love with him

365
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,130
Don't let him

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,760
Do me a favor

367
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,400
Don't screw
it up this time

368
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,920
I went out of my
way to set this

369
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,920
one up for you
Tenma

370
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,100
Well， we'll
see about that

371
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,760
This is it

372
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,400
This is the
clock that Mr， J

373
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,580
unk ers was
talking about at

374
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,331
the hospital

375
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,280
Excuse me
about the clock…

376
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,060
Hey， what'
s going on？

377
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,840
You'realreadylateforyourdate

378
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,100
What are
you doing？

379
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,570
That's a very
beautiful watch

380
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,600
Oh

381
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,270
Why， thank you

382
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,970
I mean， I wear a
watch， but mine

383
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:32,490
is nothing

384
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,320
A trinket

385
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,430
Honestly
I don 't even check

386
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,250
the time anymore

387
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,430
I wonder why

388
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,990
Time seems to
be moving faster

389
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:41,790
and faster

390
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,770
Excuse me
but who are you？

391
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,810
I'm sorry
I don 't mean to be

392
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,570
rude， but are
you Senator Ber

393
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,970
ger's daughter
Angelica？

394
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,100
Yes

395
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,150
Goodness
you're a pretty little

396
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:54,510
thing

397
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,610
Well， aren't you？

398
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,030
Thank you， I think

399
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,490
And you're
convinced that

400
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:03,170
the entire world
revolves around

401
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,230
you， am I right？

402
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,330
Going through
life thinking

403
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,450
that there's
nothing you can

404
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,781
'thave
itmustbeverypleasant

405
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,090
I 'm sorry

406
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,810
What are you
trying to say？

407
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,770
I'm confused

408
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,170
Who are
you exactly？

409
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,770
I have this tiny
little birthmark

410
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,590
on my inner thigh

411
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,330
He used to kiss it

412
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,861
Howheusedtolovekissingmethere

413
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,570
Dr， Tenma， that is

414
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,550
You know him？

415
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,300
Oh， no

416
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,080
See？

417
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,760
See？

418
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,180
She left
because you were late

419
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,720
and it's all
because you had

420
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:50,840
to stop in
that store

421
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,580
Oh， too bad

422
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,260
I'm sorry
about that

423
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
Can you do
me a favor and

424
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,300
apologize for me？

425
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,440
Wait

426
00:17:59,441 --> 00:17:59,920
Hey

427
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,830
Tenma

428
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,910
Maybe if you
give her a call

429
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,670
right now
she might come back

430
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,230
Who knows？

431
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,510
I want to stop
by the hospital

432
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,290
for a quick minute

433
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,850
What？

434
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,760
At this hour？

435
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,070
Ah

436
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,270
I've had
it with you

437
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,300
Fine

438
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,160
Leave

439
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
Kenzo

440
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,960
You're mine

441
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
You're all mine

442
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,500
Mr， Junkers

443
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,990
Please wait

444
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,260
Mr， Junkers

445
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,340
Kenzo

446
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,250
What's going on？

447
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,020
Wait

448
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:15,780
Kenzo

449
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,700
I have to
talk to you

450
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,280
Mr， Junkers

451
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,070
Ken

452
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,800
zo

453
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,130
Ken zo？

454
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,920
Oh

455
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,810
great

456
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,950
I broke my heel

457
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,760
Kenzo

458
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,100
I saw him
you know

459
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,380
Oh， yes

460
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,040
A year ago
in Dusseldorf

461
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,720
I saw him

462
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,480
It was Johan

463
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm sure of it

464
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,680
You saw Johan？

465
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,900
Guess I'll…

466
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,700
have to kill you
