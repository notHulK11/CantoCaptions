Mom

00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,260
Dad

4
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:19,004
Bingo

5
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,778
Bluey

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,580
- Mom
- I'm not your mom

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,606
I mean Dad

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,453
Yes

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,180
Can we play hide-and-seek now?

10
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,392
Wait a moment

11
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:41,919
Why is that stone dog statue just sitting there?

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,545
He's practicing not getting distracted.

13
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:47,448
What? You don't need to practice something like that.

14
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:48,704
Are you really sure?

15
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:49,390
Yes.

16
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:52,210
It's easy not to get distracted, watch.

17
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,882
Oh, it's a dragonfly!

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,243
Carrot sticks.

19
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,609
Hey, Bingo, let's play hide-and-seek.

20
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,589
Okay, let's play hide-and-seek!

21
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,482
This Bluey story is about

22
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:09,506
[Hide-and-Seek]

23
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,225
Okay, you guys hide.

24
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,884
I'm going to catch you, start!

25
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,086
One, two...

26
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:15,292
Wait a moment.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,066
-Yeah, wait a moment.
-Wait a moment.

28
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:18,827
If you want us to hide,

29
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:20,643
Then you have to promise to not just play a little

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,133
and then go play with rocks.

31
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,785
I've never done that!

32
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,638
- Yes, you have!
- Yes, you have!

33
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:28,959
Okay... I promise.

34
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:30,080
- Good.
- Good.

35
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:31,265
Start now!

36
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:32,392
- One, two, three...
- Yay!

37
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,711
Oh no, Bingo, she's counting!

38
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:35,720
Hurry up, we need to hide!

39
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,664
Six, seven, eight...

40
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:39,666
Don't get distracted!

41
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:42,540
Ten, eleven, twelve...

42
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,750
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

43
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:48,273
Sixteen, seventeen...

44
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:52,166
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

45
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:54,246
Are you ready yet? I'm coming to get you!

46
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:58,010
Okay, let's think about where they might be hiding first.

47
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,496
Oh, it's a tennis ball.

48
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,069
Oh, can't get distracted, Bluey.

49
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,716
They're not here either.

50
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,793
They're really hiding well.

51
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:13,965
Is anyone here?

52
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,478
Ji-Ja-Jai!

53
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:21,015
I thought I had lost you.

54
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:25,368
Are you hungry, Ji-Ja-Jai?

55
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:26,746
Feed me!

56
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:29,019
I want to feed you, but...

57
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,973
I'm supposed to be playing hide-and-seek right now.

58
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,433
Okay, I'll quickly feed you a little something.

59
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:40,611
I don't understand why you went inside the sink cabinet.

60
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,108
Feed me!

61
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,508
Okay, where's the stuff you like to eat?

62
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,030
Ji-Ja-Jai, I know, I'm looking for it.

63
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:52,949
Found it!

64
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,740
Ji-Ja candy!

65
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:57,490
Here, for you.

66
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:01,531
Delicious...

67
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,672
Alright, I need to go back to catching them.

68
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,539
Bathroom...

69
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,034
Oh, Ji-Ja-Jai.

70
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,205
Poo-poo...

71
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:16,573
Poo-poo...

72
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,488
Okay, go on, do your business.

73
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,849
Alright, Ji-Ja-Jai.

74
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,545
I must excuse myself.

75
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,170
Okay, what was I doing just now?

76
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,331
Finished toilet…

77
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,160
Ji-Ja-Jai probably needs help washing his hands.

78
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,501
Why is it so dirty here?

79
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,396
Yes, very interesting.

80
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,587
Wash…

81
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,337
All done, Ji-Ja-Jai, no more germs.

82
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:49,490
Okay.

83
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,652
I have to go back to...

84
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,499
I forgot what I was supposed to do!

85
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh, alright then.

86
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,339
I think I'll just play with you.

87
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,023
It feels so good to see you again, Polly.

88
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,312
You have to tell me everything.

89
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:11,523
Tell me about your trip to Egypt.

90
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,202
Okay, it was so much fun!

91
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,333
Do you need some milk in your tea?

92
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,540
Yes, please.

93
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:19,216
Yours, Polly.

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,086
Do you want any, Shirley?

95
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,655
Ji-Ja-Jai!

96
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,286
This is a tea party, not a dance party!

97
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,979
Please don't be so loud!

98
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:36,449
I'm so sorry that my husband is being so rude.

99
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,825
Stop, don't!

100
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,543
He's always like this.

101
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,497
I'm sorry, Ji-Ja-Jai.

102
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,603
It's obvious we can't play together like this.

103
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,396
I'm just going to turn you off for a little bit.

104
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,467
Why don't you have a switch?

105
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:54,482
Mom, help me take out Ji-Ja-Jai's batteries!

106
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:57,463
Be quiet, Ji-Ja-Jai.

107
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,314
Mom!

108
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,487
Mom!

109
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,563
Where are you?

110
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,890
Dad!

111
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,524
Dad!

112
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:10,549
Bingo! Bingo!

113
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,382
Why isn't anyone answering me?

114
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,754
Ji-Ja-Jai, that's enough.

115
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Where have they all gone?

116
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,052
Okay, I really need some peace and quiet to think this through.

117
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:41,787
One, two, three, four.

118
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,305
Oh, that's right, I remember now.

119
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,738
-Found you!
-Nice!

120
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:49,491
Found you!

121
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,591
Found you!

122
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,450
For real...

123
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:58,631
The Christmas tree was poking my back the whole time!

124
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:01,850
Can you guys believe it?

125
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:03,169
I got distracted.

126
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,298
I actually forgot we were playing hide-and-seek.

127
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,516
- We believe it.
- We believe it.

128
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,911
That's so typical of you.

129
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,525
Now you guys hide, I'm going to catch you!

130
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:13,371
- Okay!
- Okay!

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,140
One, two, three, four...

132
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,000
Hurry, hide quickly!

133
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,139
Bingo only knows how to count to 14.

134
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,459
Oh, a dragonfly!

135
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,692
- Hurry up and walk! - Ten, eleven, twelve…

136
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:30,285
Thirteen, fourteen…

137
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,731
Ready yet? I'm coming to catch you!

138
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,217
Where could they have gone?

139
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,003
They might be hiding in…

140
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,423
The trash can!

141
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:44,656
They're not here.

142
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,696
That's right, Bluey.

143
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,326
What did you do with the Ji-Ja-Jai?

144
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,523
Oh, don't worry.

145
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,523
I put him in a very peaceful place.

146
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,706
They might be hiding in...

147
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:02,235
Here, found them!

148
