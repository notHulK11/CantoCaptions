［The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs］

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:11,502
There was a very lucky couple.

4
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:16,232
They had a goose that laid a golden egg every day.

5
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:19,694
Although they were already very lucky,

6
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:25,786
they soon felt that their wealth was not increasing fast enough.

7
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,327
Not only that,

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,120
they also thought that the goose's insides must be made of gold.

9
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:35,523
So they decided to kill it.

10
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,938
That way, they could get all the gold immediately.

11
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:44,280
But when they cut open the goose's belly,

12
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:50,119
they discovered that this goose was just like any other goose.

13
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:55,549
As a result, they didn't get rich overnight as they had hoped.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,417
Nor could they continue to enjoy the daily

15
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,037
good fortune of getting a golden egg.

16
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,656
This Aesop's fable tells us

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,512
that people should know how to be content and happy, not greedy without limits.

18
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:15,437
Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs is foolish behavior.
